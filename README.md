# UFO-Ambush
You're in your ship traveling in outer space when suddeny you encounter many enemy ufos. A single ship cannot fight them all, so you drive your ship into an asteroid belt. You hope that the asteroids will cover you from the enemy fire and even crash into some of the ufos. The goal of this game is to last as long as possible.

This is a simple 2d shooting game. The player controls a spaceship which can shoot the asteroids and ufo's. The goal is
to get a high score. The game is run on tkinter, and the code is based on the model, view, and controller modules. The 
model contains all the functions used during gameplay, the view sets up where each widget is placed on the screen, and the 
controller uses the functions from the model class to initiate the game.

## How to play
